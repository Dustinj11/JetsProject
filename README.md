# Jets Project

### Description
This program consisted of us creating a menu that gives the user 9 choices. 
The 9 choices gave the user a complete different experience under each choice.
The Jet App listed the current fleet, allows you to fly all jets, 
view the fastest jet, view the longest range jet, load cargo jets, conduct a dog fight,
add a jet, remove a jet, and then finally exit the program. 
### Technologies used
This program used Java. The program consisted of a lot of looping, switches, interfaces, 
ArrayLists, iterators, and the File reader. 
### Lessons Learned
During this program I gained a much better understanding of iterators and ArrayLists. 
prior to this program I was not fully aware of their capabilities. With these projects 
I have been over-thinking a lot of the work. I am used to conducting this in a 
orderly fashion but with this program I learned that it is okay to jump around. 
I was stuck on the parse methods and buffer list for awhile. I took a break from that 
and completely the menu and switches due to those being a lot easier. I then returned to 
the bufferlist and parse methods after reviewing some of the lessons form last week. 
This project was a great hands on experience that consisted of going down a few 
rabbit holes and then getting myself out. 

I still feel like I am 10 steps behind in this program and am constantly reviewing 
prior lessons and watching videos. I have a better time reading code more than creating
the code at this point. Like last time google was a huge friend during this project. 
This along with food truck project are going to be great examples to go back 
and refresh my memory with.
